# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT
üìù Project Title: Image classification using tensorflow
üéØ Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The task is performed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

üì¶ Libraries Used
TensorFlow & Keras: Used for building, training, and evaluating the neural network. Keras provides a user-friendly API to define deep learning models.

Matplotlib: Used for visualizing training progress through plots of accuracy and loss metrics.

üìö Dataset Overview
The project uses the MNIST dataset, a well-known dataset for image classification in machine learning. It consists of:

60,000 training images

10,000 testing images

Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale, representing digits from 0 to 9

üß† Methodology
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
The MNIST dataset is loaded from TensorFlow‚Äôs built-in datasets module.

Images are normalized by scaling pixel values from 0‚Äì255 to 0‚Äì1 to optimize training speed and model performance.

2. Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed using Keras‚Äô Sequential API.

The model consists of:

A reshaping layer to add a channel dimension

A convolutional layer to extract spatial features

A pooling layer to reduce dimensionality

A flattening layer to convert image matrices into a vector

Dense layers for final classification

The output layer uses softmax activation to classify input into one of the 10 digit classes.

3. Compilation
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer for efficient training.

Sparse categorical crossentropy is used as the loss function since labels are integers and the task is multi-class classification.

The model is evaluated based on accuracy.

4. Training
The model is trained for a specified number of epochs with a portion of the training data reserved for validation.

Training history, including both training and validation accuracy, is recorded.

5. Evaluation
After training, the model is tested on the unseen test dataset to measure real-world performance.

The test accuracy provides a key indicator of the model‚Äôs ability to generalize.

6. Visualization
Using Matplotlib, a line chart is plotted showing training and validation accuracy across all epochs.

This visualization helps in identifying trends like overfitting or underfitting.

2. Loading the Dataset
MNIST is loaded using TensorFlow‚Äôs built-in API:

python
Copy
Edit
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test: Image data

y_train, y_test: Corresponding labels

3. Data Preprocessing
All image pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0

This step accelerates the training process and improves model performance

4. Model Architecture
A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is defined using Sequential API:

Input Layer: Reshapes flat 28x28 input to (28, 28, 1) for CNN compatibility

Conv2D Layer: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation

MaxPooling2D: Downsamples the feature map

Flatten Layer: Converts 2D data into 1D

Dense Layer: Fully connected layer with 64 neurons

Output Layer: Softmax activation for 10-class classification

5. Compilation
The model is compiled with:

Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate)

Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy (for multi-class classification)

Metric: Accuracy

6. Training the Model
The model is trained using model.fit() for 5 epochs with a 10% validation split. Training and validation accuracy are recorded for performance tracking.

7. Model Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test set to measure generalization performance.

8. Visualization
A plot of training vs validation accuracy over epochs is displayed to analyze model convergence.

üìä Output
Test Accuracy: Displayed after model evaluation
Visualization: Accuracy trends over training epochs for both training and validation sets
